# Task 7.1 (Precedence)

## Description

Assume we have a (possibly infinite) set of events `x1, x2, x3 ...`. Those events are totally ordered via `->` that is a [strict total order](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_order). For every `x`, `y`, `z`
- Not `x -> x` (irreflexive)
- If `x -> y` then not `y -> x` (asymmetric)
- If `x -> y` and `y -> z` then `x -> z` (transitive)
- If `x != y` then `x -> y` or `y -> x` (connected)

**Side note**: usually partial orders defined via binary relation denoted as `<` but here we use symbol `->`.

Two intervals `X = (x1, x2)` and `Y = (y1, y2)` are **disjoint** iff `x2 -> y1` or `y2 -> x1`.
If `X` and `Y` are not disjoint then we say they are **overlapping** intervals.

If `X` and `Y` are disjoint and `x2 -> y1` then we say that `X` **precede** `Y` writing `X -> Y`.

### Task 7.1.1

Prove that for two arbitrary intervals `X` and `Y` at least one of the following cases holds:
- `X` and `Y` are disjoint and `X -> Y`; or
- `X` and `Y` are disjoint and `Y -> X`; or
- `X` and `Y` are overlapping intervals

### Task 7.1.2

Prove that `->` (precedence) binary relation on intervals is a partial order that:
- Irreflexive. Never true that `X -> X`.
- Antisymmetric. If `X -> Y` then not true `Y -> X`.
- Transitive. If `X -> Y` and `Y -> Z` then `X -> Z`.

Please also prove that precedence is indeed a partial order: provide an example with `X != Y` where `X -> Y` false and `Y -> X` is also false.
